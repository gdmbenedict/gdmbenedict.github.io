This is a github repo I've set up to make a portfolio using Github Pages, you can check it out by clicking on the link above. It'll also double up as a tutorial on how to re-create what I've done with your own portfolio. I've compiled some useful links at the bottom of this readme (though links will be included in the tutorial at the relevent sections) as well as a credits section for anything I used for this project. If you're looking to modify your github profile to use as a portfolio I would recommend using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) instead.

## Tutorial

### Setting up your Website
The first thing to do is to set up your provided Github Page/Website. You can follow the instructions given by github [here](https://pages.github.com) or you can follow the list of steps below. I'll be giving instructions based on using the Github Desktop client, if you're using something else go to the github provided guide instead.

1. Create your Page by creating a new **Public** respository named: *"[GithubUsername].github.io"* replacing the brackets and username with your own github username.

2. Clone your repository by clicking on the set up on desktop button on your browser or by clicking the clone respository button on the github desktop client.

Don't forget to decide what location to clone it to if you want to put it somewhere that isn't the default location.

Great! Your website is now set up. But you won't be able to see it because you haven't put in any code to handle its behaviour or any HTML to handle the front end. In the next section I'll detail how you can get it looking good easily.
