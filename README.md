This is a github repo I've set up to make a portfolio using Github Pages, you can check it out by clicking on the link above. It'll also double up as a tutorial on how to re-create what I've done with your own portfolio. I've compiled some useful links at the bottom of this readme (though links will be included in the tutorial at the relevent sections) as well as a credits section for anything I used for this project. If you're looking to modify your github profile to use as a portfolio I would recommend using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) instead.

## Tutorial

### Setting up your Website
The first thing to do is to set up your provided Github Page/Website. You can follow the instructions given by github [here](https://pages.github.com) or you can follow the list of steps below. I'll be giving instructions based on using the Github Desktop client, if you're using something else go to the github provided guide instead.

Create your Page by creating a new **Public** respository named: *"[GithubUsername].github.io"* replacing the brackets and username with your own github username.

Clone your repository by clicking on the set up on desktop button on your browser or by clicking the clone respository button on the github desktop client.

Don't forget to decide what location to clone it to if you want to put it somewhere that isn't the default location.

Great! Your website is now set up. But you won't be able to see it because you haven't put in any code to handle its behaviour or any HTML to handle the front end. In the next section I'll detail how you can get it looking good easily. You can also make an *"index.html"* file and write a little bit of html to test if the website is working.

### Getting a Template
The next thing you want to do is get a template you want to use for your website. You can get one you like from the internet, though I would personally recommend using the website [HTML5up.net](https://html5up.net/) since they have some good free templates for portfolios. I chose the template "Hyperspace" so this tutorial will be specifically on that template (though this should work for any other template from HTML5up.net). Once you have found a template you're happy with click on the download button on the option from the browsing screen, or on the top right of the template screen.

![Template Screen](https://github.com/gdmbenedict/gdmbenedict.github.io/assets/97464794/48c2dadf-2276-4a51-95a3-087a4cb50d55)

The template should be downloaded in the form of a .zip file (probably in your downloads folder). Once it's downloaded all you need to do is extract it and send the information to the git repository you cloned onto your computer like the image below. Note that I extract it to the file directly and not to it's own folder. If you do extract it to it's own folder, just move the files in the folder to your git repo root directory.

Once you've finished extracting the template all you need to do is commit and to is push it to Github to get your Github Page looking like the template. It might take a while for the Github Page to update, so don't panic if you don't see the changes for a couple minutes.
