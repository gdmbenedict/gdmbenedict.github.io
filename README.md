This is a github repo I've set up to make a portfolio using Github Pages, you can check it out by clicking on the link above. It'll also double up as a tutorial on how to re-create what I've done with your own portfolio. I've compiled some useful links at the bottom of this readme (though links will be included in the tutorial at the relevent sections) as well as a credits section for anything I used for this project. If you're looking to modify your github profile to use as a portfolio I would recommend using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) instead.
